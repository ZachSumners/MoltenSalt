# MoltenSalt
University of Calgary PHYS 598 undergraduate thesis. Application of cross correlation and machine learning techniques to analyze molten salt nuclear reactor flow.

The project is broken into three distinct sections.
1. Simulating cross correlation measurements on a molten salt nuclear reactor pipe cross section.
2. Gathering and cleaning the data from the previous step.
3. Using this processed data to train basic machine learning algorithms with scikit-learn. The goal is to improve parameter detection with ML methods.
